### Remaining Work

1. **Lint errors (~228 errors)** - Pre-existing `any` types and unused imports in scaffolding pages. These are in work-in-progress pages and don't affect production build.

2. **PRD document (docs/02-prd.md)** - Truncated to 49 lines, needs full content from the v5.0 document.

3. **Hijri date display** - UI components exist in `packages/date` but not integrated into pages.

4. **Government API integrations** - Qiwa, Mudad, GOSI, Muqeem not implemented.

5. **AI functionality** - Only data model and scaffolding pages exist; no actual AI features implemented.

6. **Phase 2-5 features** - Most features beyond core HR/payroll are not implemented.
