/**
 * Saudi Termination & Offboarding Engine
 *
 * Implements the full termination legal workflow:
 *  - Notice period calculation (Article 55 / 56)
 *  - Article 80 / 81 grounds verification gates
 *  - EOSB calculation (see eosb.ts — this module handles the workflow, not the math)
 *  - Job-search time entitlement (during notice period)
 *  - Service certificate (Article 52 / 53)
 *  - Immigration repatriation steps (iqama cancellation, exit re-entry)
 *  - Nitaqat reclassification risk assessment
 *
 * ⚠️  This is the workflow orchestrator. For EOSB amounts use eosb.ts directly.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const offboard = new TerminationWorkflow(employee, "2026-07-15");
 *   offboard.initiate({ reason: "resignation", lastWorkingDay: "2026-08-14" });
 *   offboard.computeNotice();        // notice period in days/weeks
 *   offboard.checkGrounds();        // Article 80 / 81 gate check
 *   offboard.immigrationSteps();    // repatriation checklist
